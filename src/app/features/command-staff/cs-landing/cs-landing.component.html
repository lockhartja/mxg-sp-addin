            This version of Fuse is <em>NOT</em> a traditional admin template, it's an Angular app
            written entirely with Typescript and has no jQuery dependency.
        </p>
        <p>
            While Fuse is a great tool and source for learning Angular, it also requires at least an
            entry level of Angular knowledge so you can find your way within the source code.

            Here you can find a list of core libraries, design specifications and coding standards
            that we use in Fuse:
